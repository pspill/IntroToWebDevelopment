            <p>Welcome to Intro to Web Development. We are going to learn the basics of HTML (HyperText Markup
                Language),
                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>Here are some things we are going to use throughout this course:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Github</strong> is a web site that stores source code -- we are going to use it to store
                    all of the code we write during this course. You should already have a GitHub account you are using
                    to access this web page.
                    Our code repository on GitHub is located at
                    <a href="https://github.com/pspill/IntroToWebDevelopment">IntroToWebDevelopment</a>.
                    You will have to sign in to GitHub to access this private repository, and I will add your account
                    the
                    allowed users list.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>GitHub Codespaces</strong> provides an online, browser-based development environment for us
                    to
                    write and share code for this class.
                    Just click our <a
                        href="https://pspill-literate-space-goggles-g467xxv4ww7cv9v9.github.dev/">"literate
                        space goggles" codespace link</a> to connect to the codespace, or sign in to github.com and
                    select
                    the "codespaces" tab at the top of the page.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Codepen</strong> is a website that allows you to enter short snippets of HTML, CSS, and
                    JavaScript, view how it renders, and save and
                    share your work with others. You can't build a complex web page here, but you can test out short
                    snippets, and we will use it a lot as a playground to
                    learn new concepts. You should create an account on Codepen, since you can "fork" any Codepen
                    example
                    you are viewing, which creates a copy of it in your own account
                    so you can play around with it and make changes that do not affect the original pen. I created a <a
                        href="https://codepen.io/collection/vBdJzM">Intro to Web Development Collection</a> for pens I
                    create for this class.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Mozilla Developer Network</strong> (MDN) is hands-down the best site for reference and
                    learnring material related to HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
                    When you are learning any new HTML element, JavaScript property, or JavaScript function, it's worth
                    your time to search for MDN's page on the subject.
                    Don't waste your time on W3Schools, head to MDN to get the best and most useful information.
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you want information on an HTML element like the anchor a tag, search for
                            "<code>mdn html a</code>" to try to get a search result from MDN.</li>
                        <li>For information on the CSS "border" property, search for "<code>mdn css border</code>"</li>
                        <li>For information on the JavaScript getElementById function, search for
                            "<code>mdn javascript getElementById</code>"</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you need some placeholder text, go grab some at <a href="https://loremipsum.io">Lorem Ipsum</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Placeholder images can be gotten from <a href="https://placekitten.com">Placekitten</a> or <a
