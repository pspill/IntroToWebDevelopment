<body>
    <p>Welcome to Intro to Web Development. We are going to learn the basics of HTML (HyperText Markup Language>,
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>Here are some things we are going to use throughout this course:
        <ul>
            <li>GitHub.  GitHub is a web site that stores source code -- we are going to use it to store
                all of the code we write during this course. You should already have a GitHub account you are using
                to access this web page.
                Our code repository on GitHub is located at <a href="https://github.com/pspill/IntroToWebDevelopment">IntroToWebDevelopment</a>.
                We are also using GitHub Codespaces as a simple online code editor that you can use in a browser.
